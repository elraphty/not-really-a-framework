## Not-Really-A-Framework
First things first, if you can think of a better name, please open up an issue and rename this thing because I personally hate this name but I am out of thoughts.   

# TL;DR
*__The motivation for this came from the constant news of issues with npm ecosystem. As it started catching fire, I tried taking a look inside the express git repo and it was very intimidating, thus I started building this to get ideas on how things might work and come up with implementations of the features from popular frameworks. Soon I realized that there is a huge lack of content for creating apps using node without any framework. Thus I decided to document everything as I go by learning and exploring new concepts and packages which can be used to make node app without any Framework__*


### Why:-
This project is aimed at learning some internals of designing a functional framework similar to the likes of express, sails, etc build most to the tools and features myself.

### What can I use this for:-
* As a starterkit for small to medium size personal projects.
* As a starterkit for playing around with framework design and doing low level things.
* As learning material for
    * Node Fundamentals
    * Promises, Streams, etc.
    * Some third party modules
    * Build apps using node, not some framework.

## Issues, Suggestions and Other things:-
