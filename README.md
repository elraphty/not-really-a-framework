## Not-Really-A-Framework
First things first, if you can think of a better name, please open up an issue and rename this thing because I personally hate this name but I am out of thoughts. __*"Index.js" file in the root directory serves as an example usage*.__

## Getting Started:- 
#### npm i -E nraf

Show some love to this project <3.


# TL;DR
*The motivation for this came from the constant news of issues with npm ecosystem. As this started catching fire, I tried talking a look inside the express git repo and it was very intmedating, thus I started build this to get ideas on how things might work and come up with implementations of the features from popular frameworks. Soon I realized that there is a huge lack of content for creating apps using node without any framwork. Thus I decided to document everything as I go by learning and exploring new concepts and packages which can be used to make node app without any Framework*


### Features Available :- 
* Create app using the NRAF object.
* Supports GET requests.
* Can write headers and send responses.
* Supports POST requests.

### Coming Soon:- 
* Better API to interact with request and response.
* Additional Features ...


## Ooh, btw I built a website using this, which is available [here](https://intense-dusk-47643.herokuapp.com/).

### Why:-
This project is aimed at learning some internals of designing a functional framework similar to the likes of express, sails, etc build most to the tools and features myself.

### What can I use this for:-
* As a starterkit for small to medium size personal projects.
* As a starterkit for playing around with framework design and doing low level things.
* As learning material for
    * Node Fundamentals
    * Promises, Streams, etc.
    * Some third party modules
    * Build apps using node, not some framework.
    * Teaching example or case study.

## Issues, Suggestions and Other things:-
